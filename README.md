##Investigator Generation - Call of Cthulhu (6th Edition)

This is a tool intended to simplify the creation of Investigators for the <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> roleplaying game.

Primarily, though, I'm using this project as a way to learn about AngularJS and Flask. I chose this process because
it's complex enough to be challenging but it may also be useful for some of my friends. Right now (late November 2015)
I'm playing with the front end, mostly. My aim is to guide a user through the process while generating a JSON file
to store the resulting Investigator in.

Ultimately, I'd like to provide persistence via Flask and a PostgreSQL model. For now, I've only used the model to
help sketch out the skeleton of the underlying JSON file.

ULTIMATELY ultimately, I'd like to generate a PDF from the backend so people can print out a nice character sheet.
