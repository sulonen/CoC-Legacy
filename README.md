# Investigator Generation - Call of Cthulhu (6th Edition)

This tool is intended to simplify the creation of Investigators for the
<em>Call of Cthulhu</em> roleplaying game.

Primarily, though, I'm using this project as a way to learn about
AngularJS and Node. I chose this process because it's complex enough to
be challenging but it may also be useful for some of my friends. Right
now (late November 2015) I'm playing with the front end, mostly. My aim
is to guide a user through the process while generating a JSON file
to store the resulting Investigator in.

Ultimately, I'd like to provide persistence via Node and a MongoDB model.
For now, I've only used the model to help sketch out the skeleton of
the underlying JSON file.

ULTIMATELY ultimately, I'd like to generate a PDF on the backend so
people can print out a nice character sheet.
