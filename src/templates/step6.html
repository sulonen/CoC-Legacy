      <p>The standard <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> way to handle occupations
        and skills involves selecting an occupation from a list, applying
        <em>Occupation Points</em> only to skills associated with that
        occupation, and then allocating <em>Interest Points</em> freely
        among all available skills.</p>
      <p>This method's fine if you're just starting out or if you need to
        roll up an Investigator quickly. In general, we (our CoC gaming
        group) like to pool the points and spend them as we'd like to.
        That's what I've done here.</p>
      <p>You're welcome to spend your points according to the standard
        method (that's why I've provided the two points categories), but
        you'll need to use the list in the book or work with your Keeper
        (GM) to create a custom occupation.</p>
      <p>Enter percentiles in the boxes to the right of the skills on the
        next page. The <em>Total Points</em> number will decrease as you
        spend your points. If you go over, the number will turn red and
        stay that way until you fix the percentiles. Do make sure to spend
        all your points though; unspent points are discarded.</p>
      <p><b>Please note:</b> The <em>Cthulhu Mythos</em> skill can only
        be increased by exposure to the Mythos. It can't be purchased or
        upgraded like other skills.</p>
      <p>If you want to start over, just click the "Reset" button. When
        you're done, click the "Next" button.</p>
